# Tomb of the Pharaoh - Discord CTF Bot

A customizable Discord bot designed for Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges with an ancient Egyptian theme. This bot creates an interactive puzzle experience where players must find three fragments of a sacred amulet to unlock a flag.

## Features

- **Themed Interaction**: Immersive ancient Egyptian themed messages and challenge design
- **Multi-Stage Challenge**: Three distinct puzzle fragments players must collect
- **DM-Based Gameplay**: Sends puzzle instructions via direct messages to participants
- **Rate Limiting**: Limits incorrect attempts (3 per 15 minutes) to prevent brute forcing
- **Progress Tracking**: Tracks user attempts and completions
- **Flag Redemption**: Validates solutions and awards flags upon successful completion

## Commands

### Player Commands

- `/commence_challenge`: Starts the challenge and sends puzzle instructions via DM
- `/assemble_amulet [fragment1] [fragment2] [fragment3]`: Allows players to submit their answers
- `/summon_guardian`: Provides initial instructions for the challenge

### Discord Reaction System

The bot also includes a reaction-based hint system:
- Reacting with âœ… to specific messages will DM players with correct hints
- Reacting with other emojis will DM an alternative response
